# Car Price Linear Regression Analysis

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model to analyze the relationship between a car's manufacturing year and its price using Python, `scikit-learn`, and `numpy`.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the car price dataset
  - `car_price_dataset.csv`: Dataset with car prices and manufacturing years
- `notebooks/`: Directory containing Jupyter notebooks for analysis
  - `linear_regression.ipynb`: Notebook implementing linear regression to predict car prices

## Setup Instructions

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
   ```

2. Ensure the car price dataset is in the `data/` directory:
   - The dataset should be named `car_price_dataset.csv`
   - The CSV should contain at least two columns: 'Year' and 'Price'

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open `notebooks/linear_regression.ipynb` to view the analysis
